= jQuery CommandLine
Adam Sanderson, netghost@gmail.com

A simple console built in jQuery.

== Current Features
* Absurdly easy to start using
* Basic history support
* Custom response handlers
* E4X support on browsers that handle it. (ie: var p = <person name='joe'></person>)

== Getting Started
Really basic setup:
  $('#console').commandLine()

Slightly more exciting, start a console and log a line:
  $('#console').commandLine().data('commandLine.instance').log('info', 'Welcome to your console...');

Too lazy to try that?  Look at example.html
